Hi,
please see my assignment for challenge 11.

Please note that I have done this assignment without using the library 'Splinter'.
Unfortunately I have tried different solution, however I kept getting error chromedriver not found, despite me
having it and also added to the enviroment "PATH". In fact on CMD when trying 'chromedriver --version' it would correclty 
show me the version.
Therefore I have WEBSCRAPED by using the "requests" library instead which didn't change anything a part of one or two initial lines for each script.

thank you for you patience and understanding.

All of the tasks and requirements have been completed.
